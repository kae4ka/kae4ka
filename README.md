- Currently I study data science and all of these things in Moscow Polytechnic University. Also, I work on python development and data analytics in information security team at Leroy Merlin. 👩‍🚀  
- My sphere of interests may sound very chaotic as well as my career path in computer science. I enjoy learning databases theory, development basics and artificial intelligence stuff. Moveover, I love everything about data. When I'm not overwhelmed by procrastination, I try to learn more about raw data processing and exploratory data analysis. 🦄
- Besides, I like to visit offline conferences and schools about completely different information technologies topics. I'm looking forward to contributing to some open source projects. 🎯
