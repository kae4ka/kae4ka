<samp> Hi there! <br> My name is Katerina or @kae4ka, I'm a passionate programmer from Moscow 🤗 <br>
Currently I study data science and all of these things in Moscow Polytechnic University. Also, I work on python development and data analytics in information security team at Leroy Merlin. 👩‍🚀 <br>
My sphere of interests may sound very chaotic as well as my career path in computer science. I enjoy learning databases theory, development basics and artificial intelligence stuff. Moveover, I love everything about data. When I'm not overwhelmed by procrastination, I try to learn more about raw data processing and exploratory data analysis. 🦄 <br>  
Besides, I like to visit offline conferences and schools about completely different information technologies topics. I'm looking forward to contributing to some open source projects. 🎯 <br>
Thanks for visiting my profile! You can reach me by email in profile description. <br></samp>
